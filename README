Configuration utility for the OMTI 7250 hard disk controller
============================================================

!!! WARNING !!!
This program is UNTESTED, and as such, for all I know, it might break something! Use at your own risk!

That said, this program can configure the disk parameters, run a few self-tests, and a few other functions on the OMTI 7250 hard disk controller board. xxd and sg_raw must be installed, run with "sudo lua omti.lua" or similar.
